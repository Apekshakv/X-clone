This project is a Tweet Feed Application, which simulates a basic Twitter-like feed. The key functionalities are:

Tweet Creation : Users can enter a tweet in an input field and submit it. The tweet will then be added to the feed displayed on the page.

Tweet Feed Rendering: The application dynamically generates HTML to display each tweet, including details like the profile picture, handle, tweet content, likes, retweets, and replies.

Data Persistence: Tweets are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded. When the page is reopened, the previously saved tweets are loaded and displayed.
